                    A Big Mac Meal can cost $8.99 in Los Angeles, but $10.99 in San Fransisco.
                    <br/>
                    This brought me to the conclusion that with the data of every Big Mac price in the country,
                    I could figure out a lot more about price dispersion in each city.
